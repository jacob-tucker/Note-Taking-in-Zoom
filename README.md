# Note Taking in Zoom

## Current Steps:

### Step 1
- Take notes on Google docs
- Click "SynchroNote" -> "Open Sidebar" in the top menu
- Use the start and stop button to make sections of your notes

### Step 2
- Open a Terminal and go into the /postProcessing folder
- In Terminal, run the command ```python3 main.py```. This will create a background
script waiting for new directories to appear in the Zoom folder *Note: You may have to change
the location of your Zoom folder inside main.py

### Done
Now, if a new directory appears in the Zoom folder, it will launch a webpage matching
your notes to the sections of the video. Congrats!
