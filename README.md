### Step 1
- Take notes on Google docs, name the Google Doc whatever you want, but let's name it "Test For Notes"
- Use the appsScript to take notes and watch as timestamps get put on the screen

### Step 2
- Drag the zoom recording .mp4 into /postProcessing folder
- Name the zoom recording demo_class.mp4

### Step 3
- Open a Terminal and go into the /postProcessing folder
- In Terminal, run the command ```python3 main.py "Test For Notes" "XX:XX:XX YY"```, where XX:XX:XX could take the form
of 07:38:40 and YY could either be AM or PM

### Step 4
- Open index.html
- Select the button on the webpage and click on the test.txt file that got generated when you run the
python script, it should be in the /postProcessing folder
